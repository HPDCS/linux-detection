Online Resources Contetion Detector or simply Online-ReCoDe

This is a module that exploits some custom linux kernel functionalities to identify
resource contention among processes running on the machine. In particular, we want
to spot problems within a specific time period and classify issues rising from the
concurrent execution of general tasks during that particular phase.

The custom kernel is available at https://github.com/stefanocarna/linux.
It is based on an up-to-date version of the current LTS Linux Kernel version (5.4.y).
